#summary Introduction, very basic guide and examples

= Introduction of Advanced Unsharp Mask =

I presume you understand what unsharp mask is and how it works.

First, here is an image of dialog window (v 0.8) - to get some idea what you can control and do with this plugin. Note that you can get bigger preview if you enlarge the plugin window (it fills available space automatically, just be aware that the preview keeps the square shape, this is hardcoded in gimp)

== Sharpening with this plugin ==

This is primary use of this plugin, yet I have nothing special to say about this functionality. Here is an example image:

== Non-sharpening use ==

Secondary, but very important feature is manipulation of overall contrast and/or brightness of an image. Note that it manipulates overall brightness via blurred mask, not directly pixels. So you can use this plugin also to reduce overall contrast of image while preserving (or increasing) local contrast. 

Here is an example: this image has an bright area - sky and too dark area - below. Selective mask was used to virtually split image into two separate areas and then I reduced Light to about 0.8 and increased Dark to about 0.2. Please note, there are no "halo" efect" nor artifacts between these two areas . (At least not much visible)

Below is another example, where I reduced global contrast, yet increased local contrast - sharpness of image. You can notice "hallo" efect on this image, thought not strong one -  because big radius was used (and standard mask) here.

=== Selective mask ===

I already mentioned selective mask/blurring above. Here is an example, that shows original, sharpening with normal (in the middle) and selective mask (right side). Notice halo efects in the middle section - around trees. Of course, this effect can be mitigated by bigger or contrary -smaller radius of blurring.

== Blurring the image ==

Yes, it might seem to be a paradox for sharpening tool, but when you draw sliders down to zero, image becames blurred - technically every pixel overtakes brightness from mask. You can use this for simple removal of noise -  try use selective blur mask with minimal treshold and small radius.

== Poor man's HDR ==

(from version 0.7.3) 

This is side effect of implemented algorithm, below is an example and you can visit another wiki page here: http://code.google.com/p/aumask/wiki/CrappyHDR if you are interested

=== Alternate colorspaces ===

From 0.6.5 you can use three colorspaces ("noname", HSV and HSL) and apply blur mask on general brightness, value and luminosity.

=== Final note ===

Any ideas and feedback is welcomed (to email prefferably).
