#summary Introduction, very basic guide and examples

= Advanced Unsharp Mask =

<br>

This is quite versatile plugin that can do few things with unsharp mask. Unsharp mask, if you do not know it is like blurred copy of current image (layer) that is used to sharpen the original. Sharpening here is meant increasing of distance (in brightness) between original image and the unsharp mask.

You can achieve this effect with native gimp's Unshapr mask" but my plugin is much more complex.

First, here is screenshot of latest version of plugin

==Briew overview of capabilities==

<br>

===Two types of blurring===

  * Normal
  * Selective (with post-blur alternative)

===Four types of output===

  * Image (what you get after sharpening
  * Mask (important to when tweaking setting)
  * Splitted mode (to compare effects)
  * Mask-to-img difference (for "creative" purposes)

=== Brightness via mask modification ===

level like tools that modifies 0 and 1 values, usefull when you need to compress brightness of image while preserving local contrast

=== Out-of-range protection ===

Makes sure that to pixels get below 0 or above 1 and are clipped afterwards. Just note this works with brightness, and ignore individual RGB values, so some clipping in individual channel can happen

=== Alternative colospaces ===

Primarily the plugin calculates brightness with own formula, but you can switch to HSV and HSL mode to use value/lightness

===General notes===

I presume you have plugin installed, because it is better to try it then only read about it. So open any image and start the plugin (Filters - Enhance - Aumask Sharpening). First note - preview is auto-expandable so  you might want to enlarge plugin to have the preview enlarged. There is the Output combo box under the preview, please try out some of options provided there and check results in preview.


===1. Simple sharpening===

This is very elementary function of the plugin. It is based on sharpness equalizer. Sliders changes current distance between original and mask and each one controls own distance. Keep mouse over any slider to see actual ammount. Here with this functionality, I'm not sure if "sharpness equalizer" is that usefull or better then a 'single amount' sharpening. So play with sliders and play with "radius" in the right side. You should have selected "standard blur" mode. Change the view (Output mode) in previews to see an effect. My advice is to keep all sliders in the similar level. And here is an example:

===2. Brightness modification===

One of controls on the right side is "Brightness adjustment". This modifies brightness via mask. So the effect is that it preserves local contrast. Usually with this option you will want to compress brightness range of image. So play with those two spinboxes and blur radius as well to see the effect.

Obligatory example:

===3. Selective mask - Hallo efect elimination===

I believe that you noticed "hallo" efect in areas where two areas with very different brightness meet. To avoid this I'm introducting here also selective mask (combo box in Mask Options). For now try only basic selective mask without postblur. The idea here is not to blur together areas with very different brightness. The best for you would be just play with it by yourself, change view to 'mask mode' and play with treshold (start with decreasing it)

Here is example (sorry no image of mask) and comparison of sharpening with normal and selective mask (one has hallo efect, the second one do not have):

Below is another example. (I know the photo itself is of poor quality) This example show comparison of masks and resulting images. (Normal and selective)

===4. Selective mask - Contrast reduction===

Another purpose of selective contrast mask is reduction of contrast without hallo effect. Note that sharpening here is optional.

===5. Selective mask with postblur===

Sometimes I noticed artifacts on "borders", so I added a "postblur" blurring to the script to soften transitions between areas. I dont have the example now, but keep in mind that such feature is there.

===6. Mask-to-img difference===

Another possibility (it is up to you what you could do with it) is "mask to img difference". You can select it in output combo box and also play with controls under Mask-to-Img parameters.

Examples:

last one was done using Selective blur mask, thought differences to normal mask might be not that visible

===7. HDR===

Another option how to use functionality is something like this.
