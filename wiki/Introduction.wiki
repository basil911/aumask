= Introduction of Advanced Unsharp Mask =

I presume you understand what unsharp mask is and how it works.

Let us start with an image of dialog window (v 0.5) - to get some idea what you can control and do with this plugin

= Sharpening with this plugin = 

This is primary use of this plugin, yet I have nothing special to say about this functionality. Still I enclosed one image as example.

= No sharpening use =

Secondary, but very important feature is manipulation of overall contrast and/or brightness of an image. Note that it manipulates overall brightness via blurred mask, not directly pixels. So you can use this plugin also to reduce overall contrast of image while preserving (or increasing) local contrast. 

Here is an example: notice the sky - it is darker, yet local sharpness (f.e. roofs vs. sky) was preserved or rather increased. Image was also sharpened, but this is not that noticeable.

Below is another example, where I reduced global contrast, yet increased local contrast - sharpness of image. You can notice "hallo" efect on this image, thought not strong one - this is a side-effect of using standard blurred mask for sharpening.

= Selective mask =

To avoid hallo efects (as mentioned above) I'm developing also selective mask to be used as unsharp mask, but as by now (v 0.6.2) I'm not satisfied with how it works, especially with transition between areas with significantly different brightness, so take it as an feature in development.

= Please note =

that this plugin and this wiki is still in development, any comments are welcomed...
