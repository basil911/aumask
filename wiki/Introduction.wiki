#Basic guide

= Introduction =


First, here is an image of dialog window (v 0.5) - to get some idea what it does.

= Sharpening with this plugin = 

I have nothing to say about it - you should know how unsharp mask works. So far I have no example images.

= Not sharpening use =

In dialog window you can manipulate brightness of image - note that it manipulates overall brightness via blurred mask, not directly pixels. So you can use this plugin also to reduce overall contrast of image while preserving (or enlarging) local contrast.

Here is an example: notice the sky - it is darker, yet local sharpness (f.e. roofs vs. sky) was preserved or rather increased. Image was also sharpened, but this is not that noticeable.

= Selective mask =

As by now (v 0.6.2) I'm not satisfied with how it works, so take it as an feature in development

= Please note =

that this plugin and this wiki is still in development...
