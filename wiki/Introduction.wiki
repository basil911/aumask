#summary Introduction, very basic guide and examples

= Introduction of Advanced Unsharp Mask =

I presume you understand what unsharp mask is and how it works.

First, here is an image of dialog window (v 0.7) - to get some idea what you can control and do with this plugin. Note that plugin is enlarged to get bigger preview (it fill available space automatically)

= Sharpening with this plugin = 

This is primary use of this plugin, yet I have nothing special to say about this functionality. Here is an example image:

= Non-sharpening use =

Secondary, but very important feature is manipulation of overall contrast and/or brightness of an image. Note that it manipulates overall brightness via blurred mask, not directly pixels. So you can use this plugin also to reduce overall contrast of image while preserving (or increasing) local contrast. 

Here is an example: this image has an bright area - sky and too dark area - below. Selective mask was used to virtually split image into two separate areas and then I reduced Light to about 0.8 and increased Dark to about 0.2. Please note, there are no "halo" efect" nor artifacts between these two areas . (At least not much visible)

Below is another example, where I reduced global contrast, yet increased local contrast - sharpness of image. You can notice "hallo" efect on this image, thought not strong one -  because big radius was used (and standard mask) here.

= Selective mask =

I already mentioned selective mask/blurring above. Here is an example, that shows original, sharpening with normal (in the middle) and selective mask (right side). Notice halo efects in the middle section - around trees. Of course, this effect can be mitigated by bigger or contrary -smaller radius of blurring.

= Alternate colorspaces =

From 0.6.5 you can use three colorspaces ("noname", HSV and HSL) and apply blur mask on general brightness, value and luminosity.

= Exporting mask/differences to new layer (AKA Poor man's HDR) =

(from version 0.7.3) 

There are two new buttons "Export mask" amd "Export differences". First one export mask into new layer - this is primary motive when I added this functionality.

But second one is used for (as I named it) poor man's HDR. The button exports differences between mask and image. The resulting layer looks like (crappy) HDR, especialy if you use colors from original image (swith mode for layer in layers window to "value").

There is spinbutton next to "export differences" button, where you can define multiplication of differences. As differences can be two small...

Also, keep in mind, that effect depends on radius...

However, there are two limitation with these two buttons - brightness adjustment spinboxes doesnt affect result, and preview doesnt work fully with them (You will learn when you will work with it.)

= Please note =

that plugin is still unfinished, any ideas and feedback is welcomed.
