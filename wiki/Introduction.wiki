= Advanced Unsharp Mask =

<br>

Unsharp mask is commonly used tool to increase perceived sharpness of image. Or in other words - increase local contrast of image. The Gimp by default contains unsharp mask tool, but that one is very basic. So this plugin exists to improve capabilities of the unsharp mask. See below for more info.

First, here is screenshot of latest version of plugin

==Briew overview of capabilities==

<br>

===Two types of blurring===

  * Normal (simple blur, this is standard for unsharp mask)
  * Selective (this is my additions, the purpose is to prevent occurence of halo efect between areas with too diferent brightness)

===Four types of output===

  * Sharpened image (this is expected output of this plugin)
  * Mask (might be important to see when tweaking settings)
  * Splitted mode (to compare the effect)
  * Mask-to-img difference (for "creative" purposes)

=== Brightness via mask modification ===

_Levels_ like tools that stretches or compresses the brightness rangwe of of image, usefull when you need to compress brightness of image while preserving local contrast

=== Out-of-range protection ===

During sharpening some pixels can get out of visible 0 - 1 range, with this function you can prevent this. Just note, that this works with brightness and while brightness might be kept withing 0-1 range some channels (RGB) still can get out of range and be clipped.

=== Alternative colospaces ===

Primarily the plugin calculates brightness with own formula, but you can switch to HSV and HSL mode to use value/lightness as a "brightness".

===General notes===

I presume you have plugin installed, because it is better to try it then only read about it. So open any image and start the plugin (Filters - Enhance - Aumask Sharpening). First note - preview is auto-expandable so  you might want to enlarge plugin to have the preview enlarged. There is the Output combo box under the preview, please try out some of options provided there and check results in preview.


===1. Simple sharpening===

This is very elementary function of the plugin. It is based on sharpness equalizer. Sliders changes current distance between original and mask and each one controls own distance. Keep mouse over any slider to see actual ammount. Here with this functionality, I'm not sure if _sharpness equalizer_ is that usefull or better then a 'single amount' sharpening. So play with sliders and play with "radius" in the right side. You should have selected "standard blur" mode. Change the view (_Output_ mode) in previews to see an effect. My advice is to keep all sliders in the similar level. And here is an example:

===2. Brightness modification===

One of controls on the right side is _Brightness adjustment_. This modifies brightness via mask. So the effect is that it preserves local contrast. Usually with this option you will want to compress brightness range of image. So play with those two spinboxes and _blur radius_ as well to see the effect.

Obligatory example:

===3. Selective mask - Hallo efect elimination===

I believe that you noticed "hallo" efect in areas where two areas with very different brightness meet. To avoid this I'm introducting here also _selective mask_ (combo box in _Mask Options_). For now try only basic selective mask without postblur. The idea here is not to blur together areas with very different brightness. The best for you would be just play with it by yourself, change view to _mask_ mode and play with _threshold_ (start with decreasing it)

Here is example (sorry no image of mask) and comparison of sharpening with normal and selective mask. The image is split to four strips - original, sharpened with normal mask (note halo above the trees), sharpened with selective mask and previous one once again but saturated:

Below is another example. (I know the photo itself is of poor quality) This example show comparison of masks and resulting images. (Normal and selective)

===4. Selective mask - Contrast reduction===

Another purpose of selective contrast mask is reduction of contrast without hallo effect. Note that sharpening here is optional.

===5. Selective mask with postblur===

Sometimes I noticed artifacts on "borders", so I added a "postblur" blurring to the script to soften transitions between areas. I don't have the example now, but keep in mind that such feature is there.

===6. Mask-to-img difference===

Another possibility (it is up to you what you could do with it) is _Mask-to-img difference_. Here the output is depending on radius, type of mask, but in addition you can use controls under _Mask-to-Img parameters_.

Examples:

last one was done using Selective blur mask, thought differences to normal mask might be not that visible

===7. HDR===

Another option how to use functionality is something like this.
