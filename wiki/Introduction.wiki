#summary Introduction, very basic guide and examples

= Advanced Unsharp Mask =

This is quite versatile plugin that can do few things with unsharp mask. Unsharp mask, if you do not know it is like blurred copy of current image (layer) that is used to sharpen the original. Sharpening here is meant increasing of distance (in brightness) between original image and the unsharp mask.

You can achieve this effect with native gimp's Unshapr mask" but my plugin is much more complex.

First, here is screenshot of latest version of plugin

==Briew overview of capabilities==

===Two types of blurring===

  * Normal
  * Selective (with post-blur alternative)

===Four types of output===

  * Image (what you get after sharpening
  * Mask (important to when tweaking setting)
  * Splitted mode (to compare effects)
  * Mask-to-img difference (for "creative" purposes)

=== Brightness via mask modification ===

level like tools that modifies 0 and 1 values, usefull when you need to compress brightness of image while preserving local contrast

=== Out-of-range protection ===

Makes sure that to pixels get below 0 or above 1 and are clipped afterwards. Just note this works with brightness, and ignore individual RGB values, so some clipping in individual channel can happen

=== Alternative colospaces ===

Primarily the plugin calclulates brightness with own formula, but you can switch to HSV and HSL mode to use value/lightness

== Sharpening with this plugin ==

This is primary use of this plugin, yet I have nothing special to say about this functionality. Here is an example image:

* Sharpening via mask *

Alternative procedure of sharpening is to "export differences" (look below to crappy HDR example), then change a new layer to "value" mode and play with transparency slider. You can even export two or more such layers created with different radiuses.... The advantage is that all tweaking is done with sliders and you can see effect in real-time on whole image.

== Non-sharpening use ==

Secondary, but very important feature is manipulation of overall contrast and/or brightness of an image. Note that it manipulates overall brightness via blurred mask, not directly pixels. So you can use this plugin also to reduce overall contrast of image while preserving (or increasing) local contrast. 

Here is an example: this image has an bright area - sky and too dark area - below. Selective mask was used to virtually split image into two separate areas and then I reduced Light to about 0.8 and increased Dark to about 0.2. Please note, there are no "halo" efect" nor artifacts between these two areas . (At least not much visible)

Below is another example, where I reduced global contrast, yet increased local contrast - sharpness of image. You can notice "hallo" efect on this image, thought not strong one -  because big radius was used (and standard mask) here.

=== Selective mask ===

I already mentioned selective mask/blurring above. Here is an example, that shows original, sharpening with normal (in the middle) and selective mask (right side). Notice halo efects in the middle section - around trees. Of course, this effect can be mitigated by bigger or contrary -smaller radius of blurring.

== Blurring the image ==

Yes, it might seem to be a paradox for sharpening tool, but when you draw sliders down to zero, image becames blurred - technically every pixel overtakes brightness from mask. You can use this for simple removal of noise -  try use selective blur mask with minimal treshold and small radius.

== Poor man's HDR ==

(from version 0.7.3) 

This is side effect of implemented algorithm, below is an example and you can visit another wiki page here: http://code.google.com/p/aumask/wiki/CrappyHDR if you are interested

=== Alternate colorspaces ===

From 0.6.5 you can use three colorspaces ("noname", HSV and HSL) and apply blur mask on general brightness, value and luminosity.

=== What's ahead ===

Well, I resumed work on this plugin, one of reasons is that I was not satisfied with selective blurring algorithms. So here (download section) is new version 0.8.1, still in heavy development, but it yet contains enhanced blurring algorithm. There were other changes, I will write about them once the plugin is again "stable". For now, here is a screenshot of plugin window:

=== Final note ===

Any ideas and feedback is welcomed (to email prefferably).
