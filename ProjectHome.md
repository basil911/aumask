**Sharpening tool** (gimp plugin), uses **blurred mask**. Sharpness is modified with few sliders that work like a kind of equalizer. User can control blurring parameters (radius and treshold for selective blur mask). Preview has three modes - image (with changes applied) / mask / splitted (comparison) view. Brightness of image can be chanched by levels-like tool that works indirectly - via the mask. This allows use to change overall brightness while preserving (or modifying in another way) local contrast. The tool can be used also for blurring of an image.
